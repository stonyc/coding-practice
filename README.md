# coding-practice

Comprehensive list of `Python3` solutions for HackerEarth and HackerRank as I work my way through some coding practice. The solutions here are not guaranteed to be the best, but what I found to work.

**Note:** Don't blame me for some of the less than ideal coding practices (eg. camel case) since I follow what is given by the respective sites.
